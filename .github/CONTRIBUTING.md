Contributing to Pico
====================

Pico aims to be a high quality Content Management System (CMS) but at the same time wants to give contributors freedom when submitting fixes or improvements.

By contributing to Pico, you accept and agree to the *Developer Certificate of Origin* for your present and future contributions submitted to Pico. Please refer to the ["Developer Certificate of Origin" section](https://github.com/picocms/Pico/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#developer-certificate-of-origin) in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` of our main repository.

Aside from this, we want to *encourage*, but not obligate you, the contributor, to follow our contribution guidelines. Having said that: we really appreciate it when you apply the guidelines in part or wholly as that will save us time which, in turn, we can spend on bugfixes and new features. Please refer to the [`CONTRIBUTING.md` of our main repository](https://github.com/picocms/Pico/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for our actual contribution guidelines.
